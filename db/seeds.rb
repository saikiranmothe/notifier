# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
#company_name: nil,cancies: nil, last_date: nil, exam_date: nil, age_limit: nil, edu_qualifications: nil, user_id: nil
# CompanyName.create(:company_name => "test",:first_name => "test")
